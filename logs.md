# Logs

These logs are used to indicate progress of the project as I work on it through the year. It also serves as a scratchpad for things that may be useful/relevant for the ISO.

## To-Do

- Brief read of Goldberg's NLP Paper
- Summary of Baselines:
    - Concise summary of seq2seq paper
    - Concise summary of Transformer paper
- Cover Controllable Stody Generation paper

----

### 2018/12/20 (Thursday)

- Initial completion of Goldberg's NLP paper walkthrough. There is some content that is ignored based on the premise of the ISO (e.g Recursive Neural Networks), and the more relevant contents should be covered in more detail.


### 2018/12/19 (Wednesday)

- Initial readthrough of Goldberg's NLP Primer to refresh understanding for task at hand. Currently at p46; Recurrent Neural Networks.
- Reviewed [Embedding Layers](https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-4-embedding-layers-f9a02d55ac12).
- Reviewed [Word Embeddings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PL0TmQhItY) video.
- Reviewed the dataset, relatively fast storage will be needed to store the relevant dataset ([Amazon product reviews on Electronics](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/)) as it is quite large; I will also need to contact Julain McAuley (julian.mcauley@gmail.com) to obtain a link for the whole review data as you can only retrieve a small sample on the website.


#### Reading Material
- Undergraduates at Imperial College wrote a brief but strong primer on autoencoders and NLP [here](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~js4416/163/website/nlp/).
- An okay review of `seq2seq` in the form of a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF0Rboc4IJw).
- A tutorial on [Implementing Autoencoders in Keras](https://blog.keras.io/building-autoencoders-in-keras.html).
- Quoc Le's [seminar on seq2seq](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5RY_SUJih4).
- Google's [seq2seq documentation](https://google.github.io/seq2seq/).
- [Youtube summary of the Transformer paper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDulhoQ2pro) (Attention Is All You Need).
- Andrew Ng's Video on calculating [Derivatives with Computation Graphs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJyUyKN-XBQ).


### 2018/12/18 (Tuesday)

- Changed schedule meeting to 2019/01/02 due to unforseen changes to University opening times.
- Expectations of pre-assignment have changed; they are now to present the following for the meeting:
    - To have a plan of the report ready to show
    - To start planning and writing the theoretical aspects of the report (around 10 pages for this section)
    - To provide some code indicating the understanding of the problem at hand.
