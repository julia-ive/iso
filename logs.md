# Logs

These logs are used to indicate progress of the project as I work on it through the year. It also serves as a scratchpad for things that may be useful/relevant for the ISO.

### 2018/12/19

- Initial readthrough of Goldberg's NLP Primer to refresh understanding for task at hand.
- Reviewed [Embedding Layers](https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-4-embedding-layers-f9a02d55ac12).
- Reviewed [Word Embeddings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PL0TmQhItY) video.
- Reviewed the dataset, relatively fast storage will be needed to store the relevant dataset ([Amazon product reviews on Electronics](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/)) as it is quite large; I will also need to contact Julain McAuley (julian.mcauley@gmail.com) to obtain a link for the whole review data as you can only retrieve a small sample on the website.

### 2018/12/18

- Changed schedule meeting to 2019/01/02 due to unforseen changes to University opening times.
- Expectations of pre-assignment have changed; they are now to present the following for the meeting:
    - To have a plan of the report ready
    - To start wriging the theoretical aspects of the report (around 10 pages for this section)
    - To provide some code indicating the understanding of the problem at hand.
